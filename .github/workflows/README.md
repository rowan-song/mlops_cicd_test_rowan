# CI/CD Workflow Definitions
This directory contains CI/CD workflow definitions using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions),
under ``workflows``. These workflows cover testing and deployment of both ML code (for model training, batch inference, etc) and 
Databricks ML resource definitions.
